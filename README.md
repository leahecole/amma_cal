# Amma CAL
This project exists solely to help me plan a blanket I'm crocheting - the [Amma Cal](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/amma-cal)


I want to draw a representation of my color planning and to make sure the distribution of colors is aesthetically pleasing. 

I am a computer scientist and normally I do things zero-indexed when I'm programming. But, when I'm crocheting, everything is 1-indexed. In this program, sometimes I don't make things zero indexed and sometimes I do. Oh well! Maybe someday I'll clean it up. Or not!

# TODO
- [x] start out by making each square only fill with white
- [ ] properly annotate the Amma type of each square
- [ ] create enums of the colors used
- [ ] update SAGA squares to fill with the base color on the inner rectangle
- [ ] add functions to compute subsquares with each color
- [ ] experiment with color

# Would be nice TODO
- [ ] programmatically generate positioning
- [ ] encode row/column into square object
