# Amma CAL
This project exists solely to help me plan a blanket I'm crocheting - the [Amma Cal](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/amma-cal)


I want to draw a representation of my color planning and to make sure the distribution of colors is aesthetically pleasing. 

# TODO
[ ] - start out by making each square only fill with white
[ ] - properly annotate the Amma type of each square
[ ] - create enums of the colors used
[ ] - update SAGA squares to fill with the base color on the inner rectangle
[ ] - experiment with color

# Would be nice TODO
[ ] - programmatically generate positioning
[ ] - encode row/column into square object
